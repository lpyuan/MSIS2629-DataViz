###Area of Interest

In this summer, the FIFA World Cup is scheduled to take place in Russia from June 14 to July 15. The competition has been played every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. 
It is the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world and is contested by the senior men's national teams from the 208 Member Associations of FIFA. 
The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of one month – this phase is often called the Final Competition.A qualification phase, the Preliminary Competition which currently takes place over the preceding three years, is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation(s).
There are two hundred and eleven nations who can qualify for the World Cup, but only thirty-two teams actually make it. In order to qualify for the World Cup, the countries play matches against other countries in their region and depending on how many countries are in the region, only a handful can qualify. These matches take place across the time frame of 4 years, with athletes leaving their teams for a couple weeks to play with their national team.
